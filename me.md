I'm currently a Software Engineer at Google, doing ML in ads. I hope to make a big impact by improving people's experiences with ads - keeping them relevant because that's infinitely better than garbage ads for PDF viewer spam chrome extensions.

I was a student at Stanford. I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science (Theory Track) and my Master's in Artificial Intelligence.

I'm interested in deep learning and art, and have worked on projects that combine the two.
