I like creating things that give control to the user, learn by themselves, or are fast and performant. 

Projects that have recently interested me are <a href="https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix">pix2pix</a>, Mike Tyka's work with high-resolution GANs to <a href="http://mtyka.github.io/machine/learning/2017/06/06/highres-gan-faces.html">create imaginary portraits</a>, and this project using VGG-Face and logistic regression to <a href="https://osf.io/zn79k/">detect sexual orientation</a>.
