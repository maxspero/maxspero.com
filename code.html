I like creating things that give control to the user, learn by themselves, or are fast and performant. 

Projects that have recently interested me are <a href="https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix">pix2pix</a> and Mike Tyka's work with high-resolution GANs to <a href="http://mtyka.github.io/machine/learning/2017/06/06/highres-gan-faces.html">create imaginary portraits</a>.
